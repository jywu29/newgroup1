           <strong>PYHTON</strong>-is a popular and beginner-friendly 
            programming language used for various applications, including web development, software creation,
         and automation. It is a general-purpose language, meaning it is not limited to specific tasks and 
         can be used in many fields, such as data analysis and machine learning. Its simplicity and versatility
          have made it one of the most widely used programming languages today.

            <strong>C language</strong>- C is a powerful and efficient programming language used for system-level
             and application development. It is widely used in operating systems, embedded systems,
              game development, and database management due to its speed and direct memory access. With 
              its structured programming approach and portability, C remains a fundamental language in
               computer science and software engineering.

            <strong>Microservices-</strong>A software architecture approach where an application is
             broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other.

              <strong>Object-Oriented Programming-</strong>(OOP), which is a programming paradigm based
               on the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) 
               to structure code in a modular and reusable way.

            <strong>SYNTAX ERROR</strong>-A syntax error is a mistake in code that breaks the rules of a
             programming language, preventing it from running properly. It usually happens due to
              incorrect punctuation, misspelled commands, or other formatting issues, causing an error
               message to appear. To avoid syntax errors, programmers should follow language rules
                carefully and use debugging tools or IDEs for easier troubleshooting.

                <strong>TOKEN AUTHENTICATION-</strong>Authentication tokens are created by an authentication service
                 and contain information that enables a user to verify their identity without entering
                  login credentials. Tokens expire: When a user finishes their browsing session and logs
                   out of the service, the token they were granted is destroyed.

          <b> HYPERTEXT PREPROCESSOR</b><br><p></p>   
          <strong>PHP-</strong> is a server-side scripting language that is popular in web development. PHP is executed 
          on the server, which then gets translated into the client-side using HTML code. 
          Your web browser will then create an output.

        <b>CLOUD COMPUTING</b><br><p></p>
            <strong>CLOUD COMPUTING-</strong>is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases,
             networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer 
             faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

            <b>LOAD BALANCER</b><br><p></p>
                <strong>A load balancer-</strong>a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts 
                as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.
